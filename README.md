# CRUD-Car-Web-App
Designed a CRUD web application for tracking users and their cars. Implemented user authentication using SQLite to store the information about the users and their cars. Users could create an account or login to create, read, update, or delete their cars.

## Features  

- **User Authentication**: Create and log into accounts using a secure connection to an SQLite database.
- **View Menu**: Populates a table with all cars from the database, buttons for updating and deleting cars only display for the current user's cars.
- **Create Menu**: Displays 3 text boxes for a user to input information: Brand, Model, Price. And a create button that added the information into the database.
- **Update Button**: Loaded the create page with the text boxes pre-populated with the selected cars information. Users could change the information and it would update in the database.
- **Delete Button**: Users could delete a car from their account.

## Technical Details  

- **Code**: The application was created using a mix of Python and Java. Also used HTML for the text boxes and buttons and CSS for styling.
- **Database**: User and Car information was stored using SQLite as a database.
- **IDE** Code was created using Pycharm Community Edition 2024.2.0.1.
- **Scope**: This was a final project for our Web Development class. I wanted to incorporate sockets to allow multiple users on the application at the same time, however I didn't get to incorporate this part.
